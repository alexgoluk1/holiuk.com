<p>Dear Mr. Holiuk,</p>
<p>We acknowledge receipt of your email dated 13 March 2025 and thank
you for getting in touch with us.</p>
<p>As you correctly noted, you may stay in Switzerland and the Schengen
Area for up to 90 days for tourism. Since your stay does not exceed 90
days and you will not earn income, you do not need a permit and can
enter as a tourist.</p>
<p>We hope this information has been helpful to you.</p>

<p>[Original English: Dear] Migration Office,</p>
<p>[Original English: I have been shortlisted for an art competition in
Basel (https//www.kieferhablitzel.ch/en/bildende-kunst/fine-arts) for
which I must be physically present there between May 10th (for
preparation) and July the 16th (opening). I do not receive any payment
for participation, but I may win a prize.]</p>
<p>[page break]</p>
<p>[Original English: I am a national of Ukraine. I am currently in
Mexico. I used to live in Switzerland for 2.5 years, but my Swiss visa
expired yesterday. As a national of Ukraine, I can enter the Schengen
area without a visa for 90 days. My plan was to come to Switzerland
around May 10th as a tourist and start preparing for the exhibition. I
have written to a Swiss Embassy in Mexico, however, they told me they
are not responsible for my case. Afterwards, I intend to travel to
Germany, where I have an artistic residency starting in July.</p>
<p>I am attaching my invitation letter to this email.</p>
<p>I would like to make sure I have all the proper documents and
permissions to enter. Would be grateful for your reply!</p>
